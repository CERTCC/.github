**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) is part of the [Software Engineering Institute](https://www.sei.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu).
Our presence here on GitHub provides open source tools, data, and documentation in support of our research and development efforts in cybersecurity threat and vulnerability analysis.
